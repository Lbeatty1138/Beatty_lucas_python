	<h1>I've been looking at the Data for the metals earned from 1896-2014</h1>
	<p>I've been digging around the data for the medal counts for each country because I've always found the Olympics rather fascinating and that's what drove me to do my best in hockey and even earning my own gold medal. So looking at the data I’ve found some real eye-opening information that I thought that I’d share and let others just because they are neat.</p>

    		<h3>So what is it we are looking at?</h3>
    		<p>One of the most interesting things that I found when rooting through Canada’s info was that both Genders after the 1980s the gap of who was earning more medals was significantly leaping in closing the gap, even in the 2000s almost completely reversing the stats!</p>

	    	<h3>Hockey Truly is Canada's sport</h3>
	    	<p>Everyone that Canada is known for hockey but there's a clear reason for that this very clear seeing that not only is it 57% of our medals but its more than double its second; skating, that's  quite impressive and puts a large smile on my face.</p>

	    	<h3>just looking at this chart is says allot</h3>
	    	<p>after doing poor for two decades Canada kicked it into high gear and the Olympics and kicked it out of the park, clearly improving its importance in the decades since and its become quite the national pride. Being raised in the 90s and not having much national pride even the Olympics give me an unbelievable pride when the winter games come along and this is most likely why!p>
